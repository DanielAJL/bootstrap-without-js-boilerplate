# <b>A Bootstrap (WITHOUT JS/JQUERY) boilerplate</b>
This is a repository made to easily start new projects with a minimalistic boilerplate. It saves time and let's you freely practice your JavaScript.

It contains:
<uL>
<li>A basic section which includes a container, row and column.</li>
<li>A three column footer.</li>
<li>Basic file structure setup.</li>
</ul>

## <b>Why?</b>
Bootstrap is a huge library with many files and lines of code. Not every line of code is being used by the developer(s). I got rid of the JS/JQuery files to be able to add functionality to the components I make myself. That way I get rid of unused code, and, for example, can freely build my own carousel.

## <b>Important</b>
Please note that many, if not all, of the bootstrap components that require JS or JQuery will <u><b>NOT</b></u> work. If you do need all of them to work, please visit <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="blank">The Official Bootstrap Website</a> to get the full library.
